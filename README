spherical_trades.c is a plugin for plantri that produces spherical
latin trades. Here is an example trade:

5 2 5
10
0 0 0
0 1 1
1 1 0
1 0 2
2 0 3
3 0 4
4 0 1
4 1 4
3 1 3
2 1 2

The first line says that there are 5 rows, 2 columns, and 5 symbols in
the trade. The next line says that there are 10 entries in the trade
(so 10 lines follow). Each of the next 10 lines is of the form x y z,
meaning that symbol z appearas in the cell at row x, column y.

spherical_trades_binary.c produces the same data but in packed
binary format.

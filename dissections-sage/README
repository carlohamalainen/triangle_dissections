Title: An enumeration of equilateral triangle dissections

Abstract: We enumerate all dissections of an equilateral triangle into
smaller equilateral triangles up to size 20, where each triangle has
integer side lengths. A perfect dissection has no two triangles of the
same side, counting up- and down-oriented triangles as different. We
computationally prove W. T. Tutte's conjecture that the smallest
perfect dissection has size 15 and we find all perfect dissections
up to size 20.
